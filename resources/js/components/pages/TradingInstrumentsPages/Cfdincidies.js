              <p className="aboutDetailText">
              Indices, or indexes, are portfolios of stocks. These stocks are grouped together in accordance with a particular sector or a particular market: the GERM30 (or GER 30), for example, consists of 30 major German companies trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The ND100m includes stocks from the top technology companies in the US.

              <h4 className="aboutDetailTitle text-light">How does CFD trading on spot indices work?
</h4>
              <p className="aboutDetailText">
              A Contract for Difference (CFD) is a contract made between a buyer and a seller for a specified product. The seller agrees to pay the buyer the price difference between the current price and the price at the end of the contract. This means that when you trade CFDs on indices, you are aiming to profit from the movement of an index - instead of investing in the index itself. Investors trade CFDs on spot indices on online trading platforms, using stock trading accounts
